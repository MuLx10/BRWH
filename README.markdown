# BizReach World Hackathon Project

***Group: Mehul and his Chinese friends***

***Project Name: Coder Finder***

### Background

As a *Recruitment Agency*, we wanna provide better service for both job-seekers and cooperators. Take IT industry as an entry point, we conduct a analysis on gihtub via github official api and some other third-party tools. 

The service we wanna provide finally is the excellent candidataes in such programming areas for cooperators and a general distribution of the IT industry itself for coders.

### Rank

Evaluate and rank (Java) coders.

Inspired by ***Page Rank*** algorithm of Google, we evaluated various event conducted by the coders,implement **page rank** algorithm and apply on the coder-following-graph and score each coder based on the algorithm output and other attributes.


### Recommend

Recommend coders who are most interested in companies.

We analyzed all the coders' repositories. For those coders who work in companies, we assumed that their repositories are related to their company.So for all the coders who do not work in any companies, we can calculate the percentage of their repositions which related to each company. And we will recommand companies with top 9 coders whose repositions are most correlated with these companies.

### Analyze and statistic github data

Conduct a Statistic on github to have a command of the distribution of the language and license rank among around 370,000 repo and calculate the **TGI(Target Group Index)**
